## Decentralized Stock Market

In a decentralized stock market, the process of buying and selling stocks is done through smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into the code. This eliminates the need for intermediaries such as stockbrokers and reduces the cost of transactions.

A decentralized stock market also offers increased transparency, as all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be viewed by anyone. It also offers increased security, as the decentralized nature of the network makes it resistant to hacking and other forms of tampering.

One example of a decentralized stock market is the Ethereum-based platform called NEX, which allows users to trade a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and commodities, in a decentralized and secure manner.

This kind of decentralized stock market is still in its early stages of development, but it holds a lot of promise as a way to democratize access to the stock market and make it more accessible to a wider range of investors.
